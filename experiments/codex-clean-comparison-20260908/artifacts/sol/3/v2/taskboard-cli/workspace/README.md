# Taskboard CLI

A dependency-free TypeScript task manager for [Bun](https://bun.sh/). Tasks are stored in `.taskboard.json` in the current directory, or at the path specified by `TASKBOARD_FILE`.

```sh
bun run src/cli.ts add --title "Ship release" --tags work,urgent --due 2026-09-30
bun run src/cli.ts list --status open --tag work
bun run src/cli.ts list --overdue 2026-10-01
bun run src/cli.ts done 1
bun run src/cli.ts delete 1
bun run src/cli.ts stats
```

Every successful invocation writes one JSON value to stdout. Errors are written to stderr and return a non-zero status. Writes use a sibling temporary file and atomic rename; malformed existing data is rejected and left untouched.

Run the integration tests with:

```sh
bun test
```
